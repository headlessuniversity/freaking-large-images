# 🖼️ Freaking Large Images - React Router 7 Demo

A modern React Router 7 application demonstrating image optimization techniques
and performance comparisons between large, unoptimized images and optimized
images.

## ✅ What's Working

This is a **real** React Router 7 application with:

- 🚀 **Server-side rendering** - Not just client-side routing
- ⚡️ **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**
- 📦 **Asset bundling and optimization**
- 🔄 **Data loading and mutations** with loader functions
- 🔒 **TypeScript** by default with proper Route types
- 🎉 **Tailwind CSS** for styling (v4.1.4)
- 🌐 **Netlify deployment** ready with functions
- 📖 **File-based routing** in `app/routes/`

## Tech Stack - Latest Versions

- **React Router 7** (v7.7.1) - Full-stack React framework with SSR
- **React** (v19.1.0) - Latest React with concurrent features
- **Vite** (v6.3.3) - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** (v4.1.4) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Netlify Functions** - Serverless backend capabilities
- **TypeScript** (v5.8.3) - Full type safety

## Getting Started

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

This uses React Router 7's file-based routing:

```
app/
├── routes.ts           # Route configuration
├── routes/
│   └── home.tsx        # Home route with loader function
├── root.tsx            # Root layout component
├── app.css             # Global styles with Tailwind
└── welcome/            # Welcome component
```

## Deployment

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/remix-run/react-router-templates&create_from_path=netlify)

This app is pre-configured for Netlify deployment with:

- `netlify.toml` configuration
- Netlify Functions support
- Automatic deployments

## Next Steps - Image Optimization Demo

Ready to build:

1. 📸 **Large images demo route** - Show slow-loading unoptimized images
2. ⚡ **Optimized images demo route** - Show fast-loading optimized images
3. 📊 **Comparison page** - Side-by-side performance comparison
4. 🔍 **Performance monitoring** - Load time measurements
5. 🎛️ **Optimization techniques** - WebP format conversion, responsive images,
   lazy loading

## Image Optimization Features to Implement

- **File Format Optimization**: WebP vs JPEG vs PNG comparison
- **Responsive Images**: `srcset` for different screen sizes
- **Lazy Loading**: Intersection Observer API implementation
- **Progressive Loading**: Blur-up effect while loading
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time load time measurements
- **Network Simulation**: Throttling controls for testing

**Status**: ✅ React Router 7 with Netlify template working perfectly!  
**Next**: Ready to build image optimization demonstrations

Built with ❤️ using React Router 7 and deployed on Netlify.
